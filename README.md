# Javascript Essentials On the Job

## Project Description ðŸ“„

Welcome to JavaScript Essentials! In this ongoing assignment, you will learn the basics of JavaScript, one of the most important languages for web development. This project will guide you through understanding and practicing JavaScript's core concepts, including data types, variables, and basic syntax. The goal is to help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript, preparing you for more advanced topics like functions, conditionals, and loops in future lessons.

Through this assignment, you'll complete tasks that introduce the essential building blocks of JavaScript programming. Each section is designed to reinforce your understanding and give you hands-on experience with the basics of coding in JavaScript.

## Scenario ðŸŒŸ

You have taken on a client who is a small but growing business. Your task is to build the Javascript logic that powers everything behind the scenes for their products.

### Choose Your Client:
- Band
- Pet Store
- Bakery
- Gym
- Or your own idea!

## Key Stages of the Project ðŸš€

1. **Basic HTML Structure**: Set up the core structure of your website.
2. **CSS Styling**: Enhance your site using various CSS techniques.
3. **Advanced Design**: Utilize CSS frameworks to create a polished, responsive design.

Review the included example which represents the kind of site you'll have created by the time you finish all 4 on the job projects." Adjust to your preference.

## Resources ðŸ“¦

Free stock images and videos can be downloaded at https://www.pexels.com.

Utilize documentation such as [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for all things related to HTML and CSS.

Use AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude to help you learn. As you integrate AI tools into your learning process, it's essential to use them responsibly. AI can be a powerful resource to assist you, but itâ€™s important to ensure that you truly understand and engage with the content it generates. This will not only enhance your learning experience but also help you develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Checkpoint 1 âœ‹

### Getting Started ðŸ“„

You will now take your existing web page that you have previously created and transform it using CSS Bootstrap. The goal is to enhance the design, responsiveness, and overall user experience by applying Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, components, and utilities. You will start by analyzing the current structure of your web page, then systematically integrate Bootstrap classes to achieve a modern, professional look.

This activity will challenge you to think critically about layout, component selection, and responsiveness as you apply Bootstrapâ€™s features to your design. By the end of this exercise, you will have a refined web page that not only looks better but also adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

You have many options here. AI can take your existing code and apply Bootstrap to it but check to ensure that the outcome is what you want. You may have to followup to fix certain issues that may arise. If you go this route then be sure to only have AI convert small sections at a time (navbar, main content, etc) rather than the whole thing at once. Another option is to look at your existing code and have the AI generate something similar and then you apply your desired changes.

#### Deliverables âœ…

- [ ] Create a new repository. `cd` into it and create an `index.js` file.
- [ ] `console.log('hello world')` and run `node index.js`. Ensure you see the output `hello world`. Once you know that is worked you can delete that line.
- [ ] Determine what kind of eCommerce store you would like to build.
- [ ] Create a variable called `storeName` and assign the appropriate value.
- [ ] Create a variable to represent the type of eCommerce store: bakery, pet store, etc.
- [ ] Create 5-6 variables to represent various products related to your chosen store. Avoid using arrays or objects for now.
- [ ] Create variables to represent the price of each of those prices.
- [ ] Create a variable to represent the hours of your store. Do some research to see which data type works best for this.
- [ ] Commit and push up your work to github.

It will look a bit cluttered to start. We will learn new features of Javascript to clean these up as we go forward.

#### Tips

- Make sure you name your variables appropriately.
- Ensure you are using the appropriate data type for each variable. The name of your store and products should be strings, while prices should be numbers.
