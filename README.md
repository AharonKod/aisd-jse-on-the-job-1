# Javascript Essentials On the Job

## Project Description üìÑ

Welcome to JavaScript Essentials! In this ongoing assignment, you will learn the basics of JavaScript, one of the most important languages for web development. This project will guide you through understanding and practicing JavaScript's core concepts, including data types, variables, and basic syntax. The goal is to help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript, preparing you for more advanced topics like functions, conditionals, and loops in future lessons.

Through this assignment, you'll complete tasks that introduce the essential building blocks of JavaScript programming. Each section is designed to reinforce your understanding and give you hands-on experience with the basics of coding in JavaScript.

## Scenario üåü

You have taken on a client who is a small but growing business. Your task is to build the Javascript logic that powers everything behind the scenes for their products.

### Choose Your Client:
- Band
- Pet Store
- Bakery
- Gym
- Or your own idea!

## Key Stages of the Project üöÄ

1. **Basic HTML Structure**: Set up the core structure of your website.
2. **CSS Styling**: Enhance your site using various CSS techniques.
3. **Advanced Design**: Utilize CSS frameworks to create a polished, responsive design.

Review the included example which represents the kind of site you'll have created by the time you finish all 4 on the job projects." Adjust to your preference.

## Resources üì¶

Free stock images and videos can be downloaded at https://www.pexels.com.

Utilize documentation such as [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for all things related to HTML and CSS.

Use AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude to help you learn. As you integrate AI tools into your learning process, it's essential to use them responsibly. AI can be a powerful resource to assist you, but it‚Äôs important to ensure that you truly understand and engage with the content it generates. This will not only enhance your learning experience but also help you develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Checkpoint 1 ‚úã

## Getting Started üìÑ

In this activity, you will take your first steps in JavaScript by setting up a basic project for your chosen eCommerce store. This exercise will help you get familiar with the process of creating and running JavaScript code, as well as defining variables that represent key elements of your store. The focus is on understanding the essentials: declaring variables, working with different data types, and setting up a foundation for your JavaScript journey.

You will create a simple eCommerce store concept using basic JavaScript. You'll define variables for the store name, store type, various products, their prices, and store hours, then display them using console.log.

## Expected Project Structure üèóÔ∏è
```plaintext
PawsClawsPetStore/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Deliverables ‚úÖ

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and Files**
  - [ ] Create a folder named `PawsClawsPetStore` to store all your project files.
  
  - [ ] Now `cd` into that new folder you created.
   
  - [ ] Inside the `PawsClawsPetStore` folder, create a file named `index.js`. This will be your main JavaScript file.
   
## 2. **Test your environment**

  - [ ] Write this initial code in the index.js file.

```javascript
console.log('hello world');

```

  - [ ] Run the code to verify it.

```bash
node index.js

```

If you see "hello world" in the terminal, the setup is successful.

```

  - [ ] Once confirmed, delete the console.log('hello world') line.







- [ ] `console.log('hello world')` and run `node index.js`. Ensure you see the output `hello world`. Once you know that is worked you can delete that line.
- [ ] Determine what kind of eCommerce store you would like to build.
- [ ] Create a variable called `storeName` and assign the appropriate value.
- [ ] Create a variable to represent the type of eCommerce store: bakery, pet store, etc.
- [ ] Create 5-6 variables to represent various products related to your chosen store. Avoid using arrays or objects for now.
- [ ] Create variables to represent the price of each of those prices.
- [ ] Create a variable to represent the hours of your store. Do some research to see which data type works best for this.
- [ ] Commit and push up your work to github.

It will look a bit cluttered to start. We will learn new features of Javascript to clean these up as we go forward.

#### Tips

- Make sure you name your variables appropriately.
- Ensure you are using the appropriate data type for each variable. The name of your store and products should be strings, while prices should be numbers.
